						As a result of globalisation, the issues we face today have shifted from local to global ones. Climate change, global inequality, structural violence, poverty, racism… These issues cannot be tackled nationally anymore. They call for global collaboration. Yet with seven continents, 194 states, 7.6 billion people, more than 7000 languages, such a joint effort can prove to be challenging. I believe that that is where education is crucial. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Although the current education system has a large focus on hard skills, it is the most successful in providing students with an understanding of their community. When interacting with teachers and classmates, we come into contact with people from various age groups and backgrounds. A miniature version of society is presented to us and we learn from it, incorporating it into our view of the community around us. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The school of tomorrow should shift its focus from hierarchy and authority to a peer-to-peer network where students learn about the world through their peers. Due to the advances in  technology, students have the opportunity to come into contact with those from different backgrounds and beliefs, overcoming distance and language barriers. By discussing ethical and global issues together, students would become more empathic and open towards different cultures. This flexibility of mind is crucial for the leaders of the future. Moreover, students will grasp that the only way to tackle those global problems is through international concert.

						Students would be in regular contact with peers all over the world, should solve problem sets with them but also discuss casual questions about their daily life. Therefore, this network would be an additional resource to classroom learning - which obviously will be very dependent on technology as well.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						As there will be so many new incentives and influences, it is crucial that the teachers provide a stable environment to reflect on all the experiences. Therefore, teachers’ education should focus less on factual content and more on pedagogics. Technology can provide us with knowledge, but empathy and social skills - that is where good teachers are essential. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						To illustrate this concept, I built an interactive map where people from all over the world explain what they think is great about their education system and what obstacles they had to overcome. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Xx insert examples from the map
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The map is just the beginning. Hopefully, these short videos are the incentive for meaningful cultural exchanges aiming for worldwide participation.
						In my case, I was lucky enough to experience a very international education, being able to study in Austria, Lithuania, China and the UK. Nevertheless, I believe everyone should have the chance to have that - and for the first time in human history technology allows us to do that.
